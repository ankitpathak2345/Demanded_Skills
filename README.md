Insights:

Since the data is raw and each entry contains different skills, we need to separate them for clearer analysis. This will allow us to categorize and quantify the skills more effectively,
enabling us to identify trends and gaps in the data. By breaking down the skill sets into individual components,
we can better understand the specific qualifications that are in demand and tailor our strategies accordingly. 
Additionally, this separation will facilitate more accurate comparisons and visualizations, leading to more informed decision-making.
