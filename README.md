This dataset can be used for various research tasks such as job market analysis, skills mapping, job recommendation systems, and more.

Objective:

To analyze the most sought-after skills in 2024, based on data from LinkedIn, one of the leading job-hunting platforms. 
This analysis aims to provide insights into the skills that are in high demand within the IT industry, helping individuals identify areas for improvement and enhance their chances of securing positions in top IT companies.

Insights:

Since the data is raw and each entry contains different skills, we need to separate them for clearer analysis. This will allow us to categorize and quantify the skills more effectively,
enabling us to identify trends and gaps in the data. By breaking down the skill sets into individual components,
we can better understand the specific qualifications that are in demand and tailor our strategies accordingly. 
Additionally, this separation will facilitate more accurate comparisons and visualizations, leading to more informed decision-making.
